                  <h1>Peru</h1>
                  <p>
                    Peru is one of the most famous and popular countries in South America. Most people flock here to hike the Inca Trail and see Machu Picchu and let everything else take a back seat. Their loss is your gain as youâ€™ll be able to explore this incredible country
                    with few crowds (though backpackers do explore it.) Come explore the jungles, see the Amazon, head to Lake Titicaca, or to the beaches. Learn about local culture, try the coca tea, and practice your Spanish. Peru is awesome (and it
                    is very inexpensive). Stay awhile.
                    <p>

                    <h2>Accomodation</h2>
                    <p>
                      You can find hostel dorm rooms as low as 24 PEN per night, although most are in the 40-50 PEN range. Expect to pay 70-150 PEN per night for a private room that sleeps two. A night in a 2-star budget hotel with the basic amenities in Peru starts around
                      40 PEN. On Airbnb, you can find shared rooms starting around 38 PEN and entire homes starting at 135 PEN per night.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Transportation</h2>
                    <p>
                      The usual price for a 10-hour bus journey is around 40 PEN depending on how nice the bus company is. A taxi around Lima should cost no more than 50-70 PEN. Lima has brand-new, clean intra-city buses. These buses are safe (ish- petty theft is common) and
                      cost 0.50-3 PEN per trip. Microbuses (colectivos) run as well, and prices vary depending on the distance, but will always cost less than 2.50 PEN. They are a bit hectic and take some getting used to. Uber, the taxi alternative, operates
                      in two cities in Peru: Arequipa and Lima.

                My name is Nate Waters. I was born in California, but went to college in St. Louis. While in college, I took my first trip to Peru and absolutely loved it. That inspired the rest of the travel and speaking Spanish! I moved to Seattle in December of this
                past year and love it. With family and friends here, I was ready to moved back from Chicago.
