                  <h1>Spain</h1>
                  <p>
                    Daily life in Spain moves slowly and runs late. Many travelers can get frustrated by the limited store hours and seemingly laid back pace of life. But it’s this Spanish perspective — move slowly, enjoy yourself, eat well, and relax
                    — which gives the country so much character – and why I keep coming back, over and over again. Spain is a beautiful, interesting, and dynamic country with a lot of regional uniqueness and variety. Madrid and Barcelona are hip and energetic
                    cities, Granada has a Moorish touch, Basque Country up north contrast itself to Southern living. The Spaniards love visitors, hosting strangers, drinking good wine, laughing at a good meal, and enjoying life. A fiery, passionate place,
                    this country will stay withy you forever and, unlike other Western European countries, will be a lot kinder to your wallet.

                  <h2>Accomodation</h2>
                  <p>
                    Accommodation in Spain is pretty cheap when compared to other Western European countries. Dorm beds in hostels typically begin around 15 EUR per night and go as high as 30 EUR in major cities like Barcelona or Madrid. Hostel private rooms start around
                    40 EUR per night for a double. Free WiFi is standard, and it’s not uncommon to find hostels with free breakfast, either. Budget hotels begin around 45 EUR for a twin/double and go up from there. Prices will be slightly lower outside
                    of the major cities and tourist areas. Airbnb is common in most major cities, with shared accommodation starting around 25 EUR per night. For a private home or apartment, expect to pay at least 80 EUR per night.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Transportation</h2>
                  <p>
                    City metro and bus lines cost 1-3 EUR per trip. The train system (Renfe) can be expensive. High-speed trains can cost between 50-140 EUR, depending on distance and how popular the route is. Slower regional trains range between 15-45 EUR per trip. Overnight
                    buses are the cheapest inter-city option and cost around 18 EUR. When it comes to flying, your cheapest options will likely come from Madrid or Barcelona. Both cities offer flights to most hubs around the world, making them the most
                    convenient and budget-friendly choices for flight arrivals and departures.

                My name is Nate Waters. I was born in California, but went to college in St. Louis. While in college, I took my first trip to Peru and absolutely loved it. That inspired the rest of the travel and speaking Spanish! I moved to Seattle in December of this
                past year and love it. With family and friends here, I was ready to moved back from Chicago.
